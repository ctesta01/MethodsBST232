"By now you've probably figured out this is a class on linear models and
generalized linear models"

Sal's office hours: Tuesdays 4-5pm; in-person, Building 1 Room 415 

Lab time: Fridays: 2-3:30, usually Kresge LL6. 

Use the discussion section of Canvas for random questions so 
everyone has the same access to information. 

We'll assume that students know random variables, hypothesis testing,
basic probability, etc.

Kutner's *Applied Linear Statistical Models* book will be a helpful 
reference for the first half of the class, while Agresti's *Categorical 
Data Analysis* will be more helpful for the second half of the class.

```

While it would be nice for statisticians to be more often than not included
in study design, it's quite usual that statisticians are often sought out 
by their colleagues who bring them data that they want to analyze. Hence
our class will mostly take an interest in the indicated section of the idealized
scientific process, and moreover we'll assume that we're often not in a 
randomized- controlled trial. 

We'll focus on <span class='vocab'>associational studies</span>. While
it's almost always the case that when associational studies are performed 
that investigators are actually interested in are 
<span class='vocab'>causal effects</span>. However, in this class we'll tend
not to talk about causal effects or "causal" -anything because these days
causal inference tends to refer to a specific set of methods used in 
observational causal inference. 

We'll be concerned quite substantively around confounding. 

## il famoso Smoking RA Fisher

We'll talk about a lot of the methods that Ronald A. Fisher developed. 
Already in the 1900s it was being observed that there was a strong association
between smoking and lung cancer. However, Fisher was a smoker himself and 
posited that the association between lung cancer and smoking could be explained
away by some genetic or biological difference between the smoking and non-smoking
population (positing some genes that caused people to desire to smoke). 

```{r, out.width='3.5in', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Ronald Fisher's unsupported theory of genetics confounding the smoking-lung cancer relationship"}
knitr::include_graphics("standalone_figures/confounding/smoking_confounding.svg")
```

We're pretty sure that this was driven not by any substance matter expertise,
but rather by Fisher's love of smoking.

## Hormone Replacement Therapy 

In the mid- to late- 20th century there were a ton of studies linking hormone replacement
therapy for older women to better cardiovascular outcomes (lack of coronary heart disease). 

However, thankfully due to the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Study (HERS, in the early 90s) we now
know that a lot of those studies were not controlling for socioeconomic status.
It turns out that socioeconomic status was highly associated with HRT usage, and
associated at least in the US with a lot of better health outcomes across the
board.

It turned out that HRT when applied at certain times for some people can actually 
be harmful — but the point is the picture is much muddier than was initially thought
and recommendations were rolled back. Later randomized studies were performed
that produced reliable bodies of evidence demonstrating either no effect or 
in some cases harmful effects. 

We'll use the baseline data from HERS (not so much interested in the HRT treatment effect), but
to investigate the research question: 

> How is systolic blood pressure related to age, independently of other well-known
cardiovascular risk factors? (Age, diabetes, smoking, etc.)

## Prediction Studies 

Typically in prediction settings, there's no single exposure of particular interest; 
mechanisms and confounding is treated as less of a concern (if at all), and 
the main challenge is that we need to take care to not <span class='vocab'>overfit</span> 
the data. 

A major theme of this class will be that different tasks require different 
analysis strategies and diffrent statistical tools.

## Quantifying Uncertainty 

Typically standard statistical models have nice theoretical properties 
because years-and-years ago, we didn't have much data so people spent their
time studying theory instead of data. As a result, we have a lot of nice 
theories about the uncertainty represented in statistical models. 

An example of the kind of uncertainty we might be interested in 
is shown in this figure relating Alzheimer's disease rates 
and exposure to PM~2.5~. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='4in', fig.align='center'}

```

This figure is taken from the article [*Long-term effects of PM2·5 on neurological disorders in the American Medicare population: a longitudinal cohort study* by Shi et al, Lancet Planetary Health (2020)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30227-8/fulltext).

## Why Learn Methods Before Study Design

An interesting point made is that it's important to understand 
the limitations, strengths of methods, what they can and can't do, and 
how to use them before designing a study.
