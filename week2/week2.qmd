## Recap 

Equivalent forms of the canonical linear model: 

Assuming $\E[\epsilon_i] = 0$, $\Var(\epsilon_i) = \sigma^2$,
$\Cov(\epsilon_i, \epsilon_i') = 0$. 

Scalar notation: 
$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + ... + \beta_p x_{ip} + \epsilon_i$$

Vector notation

$$ Y_i = x_i' \beta + \epsilon_i$$

Expectation representations

$$\E(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + ... + \beta_p x_{ip}$$
$$\E(Y_i) = x_i' \beta$$

Parameter interpretation: the $\beta$ values represent the change
in expected value per unit change in $x$ holding the remaining predictors
constant. 

Best practices: 

  * Always include an intercept, even if it's not interpretable or 
  of substantive interest. 
  * For $K$-category predictors, include $K-1$ indicators in 
  regression (leads to ANOVA-like situations). 
  * If relationships are suspected to be nonlinear, can include 
  polynomial or other nonlinear terms.

## Confounding 

Given an outcome $Y$ and two covariates $x1$ and $x2$, should we include
$x1$ in the model? 

Suppose we didn't see the data generation process: 

```{r}
x2 <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 3.25, sd = .15)
Y <- x2*1.5 + rnorm(n = 100)
x1 <- (x2 + Y > 8)
```

But we could see marginal associations: 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data.frame(), aes(x = x2, y = Y, color = x1, shape = x1)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') + 
  ggtitle(expression(paste(x[1], " confounds the relationship between ",
                           x[2], " and ", Y)))
```

Which would show us that $x_1$ is associated with both $x_2$ and 
$Y$. 

Fitting a model with both $x_1$ and $x_2$, we would call 
the prediction of $Y$ given $x_2$ the conditional association 
between $x_2$ conditional on (or within levels of) $x_1$. 

```{r}
# observe that the association flips
jtools::summ(lm(Y ~ x2))
jtools::summ(lm(Y ~ x1 + x2))
```

This figure shows some types of bivariate confounding:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Types of confounding from Faraway, page 50", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/faraway_page50.png")
```

Examples of confounding in the HERS data: 

*How is a woman's LDL cholesterol level associated with her body mass
index (BMI)?*

In the HERS data, women with higher BMI tend to have higher LDL 
levels. However, interpreting this simple marginal association as causal might be misleading because
  
  * Older women in HERS have both lower BMI and lower LDL levels;
  * Ethnic background, as well as whether a woman smokes or drinks, also 
  predict both higher BMI and higher LDL levels. 

Thus BMI, the risk factor of interest, is associated with a number of 
other factors, or potential confounders, which also predict the outcome. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(here)
hers <- readr::read_csv(here("data/hers.csv"))

# just visualized to see how difficult it is to observe confounding
GGally::ggpairs(hers, columns = c('LDL', 'BMI', 'age'), alpha = .5)
```

Often we will just fit separate models for each of the pairwise models:

```{r}
simple_summ <-
  function(model) {
    jtools::summ(model, model.info = F, model.fit = F)
  }
simple_summ(lm(data = hers, formula = LDL ~ age))
simple_summ(lm(data = hers, formula = LDL ~ BMI))
simple_summ(lm(data = hers, formula = BMI ~ age))
simple_summ(lm(data = hers, formula = LDL ~ BMI + age))
```

In the marginal model $LDL ~ BMI$, we had an effect estimate for
BMI of 0.42 vs. 0.37 in the model with both BMI and age. So we
could say there was a `r scales::percent_format()((.42-.37)/.42)` decrease
in $\hat \beta_{BMI}$. 

A commonly used rule of thumb is that a variable is a confounder
if it changes the estimated associations of interest by >10%. However,
this is a really arbitrary threshold, so when available substantive 
knowledge should be the primary consideration for selecting confounders
a priori to any analyses. Moreover, these types of heuristic criteria 
are specific to linear regression and they change for other types of
models (e.g., logistic models for binary outcomes). 

We could condition on a few more variables that we might suspect
are possible confounders:

```{r}
simple_summ(lm(LDL ~ BMI + age + nonwhite + drinkany + smoking, data = hers))
```

The effect for $\hat \beta_{BMI}$ didn't change very much, so we can 
presume that these additional variables are not meaningful confounders
of the $LDL ~ BMI$ relationship. 

## Interaction 

We may be interested in a model with *interaction effects*: 

$$ \E(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_3 x_{i1} x_{i2}$$

We can alternatively view this model as 

$$ \E(Y_i) = (\beta_0 + \beta_2 x_{i2}) + (\beta_1 + \beta_3 x_{i2})x_{i1} + \epsilon_i.$$

(or switch the roles of $x_{i1}$ and $x_{i2}$. Interactions are 
also sometimes referred to as *effect-modification*.

Generally it's considered best practice whenever including interaction
terms to include the main-effects for any interacted variables as well. 
Sometimes in economics literature, main effects may be referred to as
"constitutive effects". 


### Statin-Use Example

For example, we might ask if the association between LDL and BMI 
differ between those who take statins (cholesterol lowering medications)
vs. those who do not? 

We center BMI so that the Statin coefficient is meaningful. 

```{r}
hers$BMI_centered <- hers$BMI - mean(hers$BMI, na.rm=TRUE)
simple_summ(lm(
  LDL ~ BMI_centered * statins + 
    age + smoking + drinkany + nonwhite,
  data = hers
))
```

Another option not-covered in class is to use the `/` operator 
to create a BMI effect within the yes/no levels of statins:

check `?formula.terms` for an explanation of the `/` operator: 

"The `/` operator provides a shorthand, so that `a / b` is equivalent to 
`a + b %in% a`."

```{r}
lm.ldl.interact <- lm(
  LDL ~ statins / BMI_centered + 
    age + smoking + drinkany + nonwhite,
  data = hers
)
simple_summ(lm.ldl.interact)
```

How do we interpret them? Often the simplest way is to just
visualize them. 

```{r}
# install.packages("interactions")
interactions::interact_plot(lm.ldl.interact,
                            pred = BMI_centered, modx = statins,
                            interval = TRUE)
```

:::{.cooltip}
*Question:* How would we interpret the magnitude of an interaction 
between 2 continuous variables? 

The coefficient estimate for an interaction with two continuous 
effects is the change in the $x_1 \sim Y$ slope corresponding to 
a 1-unit change in $x_2$.

# Estimation

## Matrix Representation of Multiple Linear Regression 

I will use math bolding *once* and then give up on it. Do not
expect more from me. It is too much of a pain to write 
in every line. 

$$ \pmb Y = \pmb X \pmb \beta + \pmb \epsilon $$

$$ \pmb Y = \left[ \begin{array}{c} Y_1 \\ Y_2 \\ \vdots \\ Y_n \end{array}  \right],
\quad \pmb X = \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 & x_{11} & x_{12} & \cdots & x_{1p} \\
1 & x_{21} & x_{22} & \cdots & x_{2p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & x_{n1} & x_{n2} & \cdots & x_{np} \\
\end{array} \right], $$

$$ \pmb \beta = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \beta_1 \\ \beta_2 \\ \vdots \\ \beta_n \end{array}  \right],
\quad \pmb \epsilon = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \epsilon_1 \\ \epsilon_2 \\ \vdots \\ \epsilon_n \end{array}  \right].$$

Now we can write (under the usual assumptions on $\epsilon_i$, we can
alternatively write $\E(\pmb Y) = \pmb X \pmb \beta$. 

This marks the spot when I shall give up on bolding vectors and matrices. 

## How should we estimate $\hat \beta$? 

Thus far we haven't made any distributional assumptions. 

Without distributional assumptions, one way forward is to simply find 
the estimate $\hat \beta$ that results in $X \hat \beta$ as close
as possible to the observed $y$. (Note teh change to a lowercase 
$y$ when referring to observed values in the sample rather than 
a random variable). 

Using Euclidean distance, the distance between the vectors 
$y$ and $X \beta$ is 

$$ d(y, X\beta) = \sqrt{(y-X\beta)'(y-X\beta)}.$$

We generally prefer not to work with square roots and since 
squaring is a momotone transformation for values on $\mathbb R^+$, 
the value that minimizes $d(y, X\beta)$ will also minimize 
$d(y,X\beta)^2$. 

$$S(\beta) = SSE = d(y,X\beta)^2 = (y-X\beta)'(y-X\beta)$$
$$ = y'y - 2y'X\beta + \beta' X' X \beta$$

The values of $\beta$ that minimize $S(\beta)$ are called
least squares estimates or ordinatry least squares (OLS) estimates. 

OLS has been around since at least the early 1800s and variously 
attributed to Gauss, Laplace, Legendre, etc.. A lot of the properties
of estimators obtained in this way were proven by Gauss. 

See Stephen Stigler's *Gauss and the Invention of Least Squares*
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/2240811>. 

To find OLS estimates, we (1) compute the gradient of $S(\beta)$,
(2) set the equation to zero, and (3) solve for $\beta$. 

$$ \frac{\partial S(\beta)}{\partial \beta } = -2X'y + 2X'X\beta \stackrel{set}{=} 0$$ 
$$ = -2X'(y-X\beta) = 0$$

This gives us the least squares normal equations:

$$ X'X \hat \beta = X' y$$

Normal equations have a relationship to geometry that "we" won't
expand on further.  Except I will!  See <https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/305748/174809> 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='5in', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("standalone_figures/normal_equation_projection.svg")
```

:::{.cooltip}
Multiply each side by $(X'X)^{-1}$ to obtain: 
$$\hat \beta (X'X)^{-1}X'y$$
provided $(X'X)^{-1}$ exists (it will if predictors are linearly independent. 

This is a good equation to commit to memory.
:::

(About now is a good time to note that $X$ is capitalized because 
it's a matrix, not because it's a random variable). 

## Simple Linear Regression Setting

$$\hat \beta_1 = 
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x)(y_i - \bar y}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x)^2} = \frac{\hat{\Cov} (x,y)}{\left(\hat{\text{sd}}(x)\right)^2} = 
\hat \rho_{xy} \left( \frac{\hat{\text{sd}}(y)}{\hat{\text{sd}}(x)} \right)$$

$$\hat{\beta_0} = \bar y - \hat \beta_1 \bar x.$$

Using these estimates, we get a <span class='vocab'>fitted value</span>
for the $i$th observation and a residual for it. 


## Properties of Least Squares Estimates

$\hat \beta$ is an unbiased estimator of $\beta$. 

$$\E(\hat \beta) = \E[\underbrace{(X'X)^{-1} X'}_{A} y] = (X'X)^{-1} X'X \beta = \beta$$

The variance of $\hat \beta$ is expressed by the **variance-covariance matrix**. 

$$\Var(\hat \beta) = (X'X)^{-1} X' \Var(Y) X (X'X)^{-1}$$
$$ = \sigma^2 (X'X)^{-1}$$

If we let $D = (X'X)^{-1}$, the variance of $\hat \beta_j = \sigma D_{jj}$
and the covariance between $\hat \beta_i$ and $\hat \beta_j$ is 
$\sigma^2 D_{ij}$.
