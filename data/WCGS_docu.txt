Western Collaborative Group Study Data
=========================================================================

This data file contains data on 3,154 participants of the WCGS, a population-based study that collected follow-up data on a group of employed men from 10 Californian companies, aged 39-59 years old, regarding the onset of coronary heart disease (CHD). Scientific interest of the study focused on several possible risk factors including lifestyle factors, such as smoking; physiological measurements, such as blood pressure and cholesterol; and certain behavioral characteristics. In the third category, particular attention was paid to behavior type, defined as follows:
 * Type B: behavior is more relaxed and noncompetitive
 * Type A: behavior is characterized by aggressiveness and competitiveness
After recruitment, from 1960-61, participants were monitored for around 9 years, although a few were lost-to-follow-up. Occurrence of CHD was determined by expert diagnosis and usually due to some form of heart attack (myocardial infarction; MI). With the except of the variables related to the CHD response (chd, type and time), all variables in the dataset were measured at the time of recruitment into the study.

Note, the text book 'Statistics in Epidemiology' by Nicholas Jewell uses these data as a case study and a reference that you might find useful is:

The variables are (in column order):

 1 age     age, years
 2 ht      height, in
 3 wt      weight, lbs
 4 sbp     systolic blood pressure, mmHg
 5 dbp     diastolic blood pressure, mmHg
 6 chol    cholesterol, mg/dL
 7 ncigs   number of cigarettes smoked per day
 8 behave  behavior type 0/1 = B/A
 9 chd     occurrence of a CHD event during follow-up
10 type    type of CHD event 0/1/2/3 = no event/symptomatic MI/unrecognized MI/angina pectoris
11 time    time post-recruitment of the CHD event, days
