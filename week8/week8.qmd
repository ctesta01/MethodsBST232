# Recap

Last time we saw several ways of dealing with heteroscedasticity: 

  * transformations, which we've already seen, but is not ideal since it changes the scientific question being asked.
  * robust variance estimators and the bootstrap â€” ways to estimate the variance alongside the OLS estimates of $\beta$. 
  * and we just started with generalized least squares.

## Generalized Least Squares

The Gauss-Markov theorem says that $\hat \beta_{OLS}$ is BLUE when $\Sigma = \sigma^2 I$, but now we're 
in a more general setting. 

If we estimate $\beta$ by minimizing the Mahalanobis distance between $Y$ and $X \beta$, we can get an estimator
that is BLUE under arbitrary $\Sigma$. 

The squared Mahalanobis distance .. 

GLS can be used for any variance-covariance matrix $\Sigma$ including with correlated data. Supposing that 
$\Sigma$ is known, one can easily show that $\hat \beta_{GLS}$ is unbiased, that it's the MLE 
if we assume $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal N(0,\Sigma)$, and its varinace is 

$$
\Var[\hat \beta_{GLS}] = (X' \Sigma X)^{-1}.
$$

We show that $\hat \beta_{GLS}$ is BLUE under heteroscedasticity by: 

  1. Writing the GLS estimator as an OLS estimator in a transformed space that has homoscedastic error, and 
  2. Applying the Gauss-Markov Theorem. 

For any positive-definite matrix $\Sigma$ we can find a nonsingular matrix $A$ such that $\Sigma = AA$. 

Assuming $\Sigma$ is known, then define $Z = A^{-1} Y$ and $C = A^{-1} X$. Linear regression in the 
transformed space is 

$$
Z = C \gamma + \varepsilon^*,
$$

where $\varepsilon^* = A^{-1} \varepsilon$. 

Note that $\E[\varepsilon^*] = 0$ and $\Var[\varepsilon^*] = I_n$, so we have homoscedastic errors in the transformed space. 

Also note that both of the following hold: 

$$\E[Z] = C \gamma
$$

$$
\E[Z] = A^{-1} \E[Y] = A^{-1} X \beta = C \beta 
$$

So $\gamma \equiv \beta$. 

The OLS estimator for this transformed regression problem is 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat \gamma_{OLS} & = (C'C)^{-1} C' Z \\ 
& = (X'\Sigma^{-1}X)^{-1} X' \Sigma^{-1} Y \\ 
& = \hat \beta_{GLS}
\end{aligned}
$$

so $\hat \beta_{GLS}$ is equivalent to the OLS estimator in the transformed space. 

By the Gauss-Markov Theorem, $\hat \beta_{GLS}$ is BLUE for $\gamma = \beta$ in the 
transformed space. 

Since $\E[\varepsilon^*] = 0$ and $\Var[\varepsilon^*] = I_n$, this implies that for any other unbiased 
estimator $\tilde \beta = DZ$, $\Var(\hat \beta_{GLS}) \leq \Var(\tilde \beta)$. 

The optimality in the transformed space is retained by $\hat \beta_{GLS}$ is the original space. This is because for any linear unbiased estimator in the original space $\tilde \beta = LY$ can also be written as a linear unbiased estimator in the transformed space, $\tilde \beta = LY = LAZ$. 

So $\hat \beta_{GLS}$ is BLUE for the linear model where $\Var[\varepsilon] = \Sigma$. 

# Weighted Least Squares 

Returning to our special case when $\Sigma = \text{diag}(\sigma_1^2, ..., \sigma_n^2)$, which 
implies the observations are independent with heteroscedasticity, this case is sometimes referred to as 
"weighted least squares," because 

$$
(Y - X \beta)' \Sigma^{-1} (Y-X\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sigma_i^2} (y_i - x_i' \beta)^2
$$

so that we are estimating $\beta$ by minimizing a weighted version of the SSE with weights $1/\sigma_i^2$. 

This effectively upweights units with low variance and downweights those with high variance so that estimates are selected to give better fit for units with low variance. 

## Estimating $\hat \beta_{GLS}$ 

In practice we don't know the $\sigma_i^2$ values and need to estimate them.  We had the 
same challenge with the robust variance estimator for the OLS estimator, $\widehat{\Var}_{HW}[\hat\beta_{OLS}]$. 

Recall our three potential estimation strategies: 

   1. Estimate $\sigma_i^2$ directly from the squared residual: $\hat \varepsilon_i^2 = (y_i - \hat \mu_i)^2
   2. Assume $\sigma_i^2 = V(\mu_i)$ and estimate $V(\cdot)$ via smoothing of $\varepsilon_i^2$ vs. $\hat \mu_i$. 
   3. Assume $\sigma_i^2 = V(\mu_i)$ and estimate $V(\cdot)$ via grouping based on $\hat \mu_i$. 

However, each of these strategies requires $\hat \mu_i = x_i' \hat \beta_{GLS}$, but estimating 
$\hat \beta_{GLS}$ requires estimates of $\sigma_i^2$. 

## Iteratively re-weighted least squares 

:::{.chilltip}
*The iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm.*

Start with an initial estimate of $\beta$, denoted $\hat \beta^{(1)}$, for which we could use the 
OLS estimator $\hat \beta_{OLS}$. 

At the $j^{th}$ iteration: 

  1. Calculate $\hat \mu_i^{(j)} = x_i' \hat \beta^{(j)}$
  2. Use the $\hat \mu_i^{(j)}$ to compute $\hat \sigma_i^{2(j)}$ using one of the three approaches outlined above
  3. Obtain a new estimate $\hat \beta^{(j+1)}$ by minimizing 

  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\hat \sigma_i^{2(j)}} (y_i - x_i' \beta)^2
  $$

  with respect to $\beta$.

  Repeat steps (1)-(3) until the value of $\hat \beta$ converges.

# Inference for Binomial Propoertions and Contingency Tables 

## The Binomial Distribution 

We will use data from a study on the teratogenicity of anti-epilectic drugs (AEDs) to motivate modeling and inference for discrete data. The data come from 922 births in 5 Boston area hospitals during 1986 and 1993 and are described in Holmes et al. (2000). The teratogenicity of anticonvulsant drugs. *New England Journal of Medicine* 344: 1132-1138. 

The study included 316 pregnant women taking anticonvulsants (intentionally over-sampled) and 606 pregnant control women and recorded whether the infants had any malformation. 

:::{.bluetip}
A teratogen is any agent that causes an abnormality following fetal exposure during pregnancy
:::

| Infant Status | N | Percent | 
|---|---|---|
|No major malformation | 895 | 97.1% | 
|Major malformation | 27 | 2.9% | 

The percent of infants with a major malformation is slightly higher than the US national rate of 2%. 

Is this difference statistically significant? 

What is the 95% confidence interval for the risk of having a major malformation based on this data? 

### The Binomial Distribution 

A binomially distributed random variable is the number of events resulting from $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability success $\pi$. 

Let $Y_i=1$ indicate that infant $i$ has a major malformation and $Y_i = 0$ otherwise. 

Each $Y_i$ comes from a Bernoulli distribution such that 

$$
\begin{aligned}
Pr(Y_i = y_i) & = \pi^{y_i} (1-\pi)^{1-y_i} \\ 
Pr(Y_i = 0) & = 1- \pi \\ 
Pr(Y_i = 1) & = \pi.
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $Y = \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$. Then $Y$ is binomial distributed and its pmf is 

$$
Pr(Y = y) = { n \choose y } \pi^y (1-\pi)^{n-y}
$$

where $y = 0, ..., n.$

Let's remind ourselves of the derivation of the mean and the variance for $Y$, a binomial distributed random variable 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\E(Y_i) & = \sum_{y_i=0}^1 y_i Pr(Y_i = y_i) \\ 
& = 0 \times Pr(Y_i = 0) + 1 \times Pr(Y_i = 1) \\ 
& = \pi \\ 
\E(Y) & = \E(Y_1) + ... + \E(Y_n) \\ 
& = n \pi.
\end{aligned}
$$

And the variance 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Var(Y_i) & = \E(Y_i - \E(Y_i))^2 \\ 
& = (0-\pi)^2 \times Pr(Y_i = 0) + (1-\pi)^2 \times Pr(Y_i = 1) \\ 
& = \pi^2 (1-\pi) + (1-\pi)^2 \pi \\ 
& = \pi(1-\pi).
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Var(Y) & = \Var(Y_1 + ... + Y_n) \\ 
& = \Var(Y_1) + ... + \Var(Y_n) \\ 
& = n \pi (1 - \pi).
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that we make use of the independence assumption. Note also that the binomial variance is a function of the mean.

```

The central limit theorem states that standardized sums or averages of independent random variables are asymptotically normal (under light regularity conditions). 

Thus asymptotically, 

$$
\frac{Y - \E(Y)}{s.e.(Y)} \sim \mathcal N(0, 1)
$$

and for $\hat \pi = Y/n$, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\hat \pi - \E[\hat \pi]}{s.e.(\hat \pi)} & \stackrel{\cdot}{\sim} \mathcal N(0,1) \quad \text{ where } \stackrel{\cdot}{\sim} \text{ indicates as } n \to \infty \\ 
\E[\hat \pi] & = \E(\frac{1}{n} - \sum Y_i) = \frac{1}{n} \cdot n \pi = \pi \\ 
\Var[\hat \pi] & = \Var\left(\frac{1}{n} \sum Y_i\right) = \frac{1}{n^2} \cdot n \pi (1-\pi) = \frac{\pi (1-\pi)}{n},
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\hat \pi = \frac{\sum Y_i}{n}.$

## Large Sample Inference: A Single Proportion 

Consider testing whether the probability of major malformation in our study sample is equal to the national probability of $\pi_0 = 0.02$. 

$$
H_0 \colon \pi = \pi_0 \quad \text{versus} \quad H_A \colon \pi \neq \pi_0.
$$

Using a Wald test: 

$$
Z_W = \frac{\hat \pi - \pi_0}{\sqrt{\hat \pi (1 - \hat \pi) / n }} \stackrel \cdot \sim \mathcal N(0,1).
$$

Plugging in to compute the Z-statistic gives 

$$
Z_W = \frac{0.0293 âˆ’ 0.02}{\sqrt{0.0293(1 âˆ’ 0.0293)/922}} = 1.67.
$$

The associated two-tailed $p$-value is given by 

$$
p = 2 \times Pr(\mathbb Z \geq 1.67) = 0.0949
$$ 

where $\mathbb Z$ is a standard normal random variable.

## Problems with Wald-based inference

Suppose we observe $y = 0$ or $y = n$, which correspond to $\hat \pi = 0$ and $\hat \pi = 1$ scenarios.

The probability of this happening is non-negligible when $n$ is small and/or when $\pi$ is close to zero or one. 

In either case, the Wald statistic, 

$$
Z_W = \frac{\hat \pi - \pi_0} { \sqrt{\hat \pi ( 1 - \hat \pi ) / n }}
$$

has a zero in the denominator and is therefore undefined. 

## A better test: the Score Statistic

The score test averts this problem by using the null rather than the estimated
standard error. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
Z_S & = \frac{\hat \pi - \pi_0}{\sqrt{\pi_0 ( 1- \pi_0)/n}} \\ 
& = \frac{0.0293 âˆ’ 0.02}{\sqrt{0.02(1 âˆ’ 0.02)/922}} = 2.02.
\end{aligned}
$$

The associated two-tailed $p$-value is given by 

$$
p = 2 \times Pr(\mathbb Z \geq 2.02) = 0.0440
$$

where $\mathbb Z$ is a standard normal random variable. 

The evidence against $H_0$ is slightly stronger using the more appropriate score test. 


```{r}
prop.test(27, 922, p = 0.02, correct = FALSE)
```

(For the purposes of this class, we'll want to specify `correct = FALSE` â€” in other settings one may want to perform the continuity correction available in `prop.test`, but we won't be using it in this class.)

The $\chi^2$ value (`X-squared`) in the output above is $(Z_S)^2$, which is approximately 
$\chi^2$ distributed under the null. The $p$-value from this $\chi^2$ test is the same as the one based on $Z_S$. 

## Confidence Intervals

:::{.cooltip}
One way of describing the confidence interval for a parameter is the set of values which, when used as the null value in a hypothesis test on the observed sample, would lead to failure to reject.
